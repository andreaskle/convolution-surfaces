# Render Convolution Surfaces using Ray Marching
This code shows an implementation of ray marching to render convolution surfaces. 

A convolution surface is defined by a distance function *d* and a filter kernel *h*.

By using analytical kernel functions, a direct analytic solution to the convolution integral can be calculated:

This example shows a skeleton with two point primitives. The normal vectors are estimated using forward differences.

Result:
